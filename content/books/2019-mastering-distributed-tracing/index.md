Currently available for pre-order at [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MBNGF7Q/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1) and [PacktPub.com](https://packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-distributed-tracing).

This book is based on my 3+ years of experience with building, deploying, and operating [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), an open-source distributed tracing platform at [Uber Technologies, Inc.](https://eng.uber.com/distributed-tracing/), and my involvement with the standardization efforts, such as the [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io) project and the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). It is a practical guide to distributed tracing, offering end-to-end (get it?) coverage of the field. 

When you read this book you will:

  * Become familiar with the history and theoretical foundations of tracing; 
  * Solve the data gathering problem through manual and automatic code instrumentation, with open standards like OpenTracing, W3C Trace Context, and OpenCensus; 
  * Consider the benefits and applications of a distributed tracing infrastructure for understanding and profiling complex systems;
  * Learn how to deploy and operate a distributed tracing platform at scale.
