While distributed tracing is a very powerful tool, Uber's microservices architecture reach a scale where a single trace contains so much information that engineers are no longer able to use them effectively to find root causes of outages. In this talk I present new techniques we developed in [Jaeger](https://jaegertracing.io) that bring the complexity of individual traces back into the realm of human comprehension. The technique has proven to be highly effective in drastically reducing time to mitigation of high severity outages.
