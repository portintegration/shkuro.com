This talk starts with a refresher of distributed tracing as a core observability tool in modern systems, from single trace view to aggregate analysis. Then we show how Uber uses data mining, complexity reduction, and intuitive visualizations to bring the real traces (not the toy examples) back into the realm of human comprehension abilities; guide the user towards actionable insights about the root cause of the outages; and drastically reduce time to mitigation.
