In this talk I show a brief demo of Jaeger and OpenTracing features, and then talk about why deploying tracing infrastructure is challenging, especially in very large organization like Uber, with heterogeneous technology platforms and multiple programming languages in use. I share the experience of rolling out tracing to over a thousand of microservices at Uber and some useful techniques we found that may help other organizations to do the same.
